# Nostr Event Store

[![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.21.5+-blue.svg)](https://golang.org)
[![Module](https://img.shields.io/badge/module-github.com%2Fhaorendashu%2Fnostr__event__store-blue.svg)](https://github.com/haorendashu/nostr_event_store)

A high-performance, crash-safe persistent event store for the Nostr protocol, featuring persistent B+Tree indexing, write-ahead logging, advanced caching strategies, and sophisticated query optimization.

## Features

### 🚀 Core Architecture

- **Multi-Index System**: Maintains four specialized index families optimized for different query patterns:
  - Primary index for ID-based lookups
  - Author+Time index for feed scanning
  - Kind+Time index for event type queries
  - Search index for tag-based queries

- **Persistent B+Tree Indexes**: All indexes are backed by disk-persisted B+Trees with configurable page sizes (4KB/8KB/16KB) and in-memory node caching

- **Crash Safety**: Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) ensures all mutations are logged before in-memory state changes, enabling complete recovery from crashes without data loss

- **Advanced Caching**: Multi-tiered caching system with dynamic memory allocation across indexes, including:
  - Generic LRU cache with count-based and memory-based eviction
  - Specialized B-tree node caching with multi-writer support
  - Partition-aware caching coordinating hot, recent, and historical data

### 💾 Storage Layer

- **Append-Only Segments**: Event records stored in append-only file segments optimized for sequential I/O
- **TLV Serialization**: Binary encoding using Type-Length-Value format for efficient storage
- **Position-based Addressing**: Lightweight (segmentID, offset) tuple addressing for index values
- **Transparent Multi-page Support**: Large events automatically split across pages with magic-number verification
- **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe operations with per-segment RWMutex protection

### 📊 Query Engine

- **Index-Driven Optimization**: Intelligently selects the best index based on filter conditions
- **Fully-Indexed Query Optimization**: Skips post-filtering when all conditions are in the index
- **Merge-Sort Strategy**: Multiple index ranges merged using heap-based algorithm (O(n log k) complexity)
- **Early Limit Application**: Applies limit immediately after sorting to avoid unnecessary data loading
- **Deduplication**: Based on disk location (SegmentID:Offset) for accurate results

### 🔄 Recovery & Maintenance

- **Dirty-Marker Recovery**: Fast recovery detection with explicit checkpoint management
- **Segment Rebuild Fallback**: Resilient recovery even with corrupted index files
- **Compaction Support**: Logical deletion with reclamation via background compaction
- **Operational Maintenance**: Checkpointing, compaction, and statistical monitoring

### 📈 Observability

- **Low-Overhead Metrics**: In-process counter collection using atomic operations
- **Prometheus Integration**: Native text format export with `/metrics` and `/health` endpoints
- **Dimensioned Statistics**: Per-domain metrics tracking cache, index, shard, and storage status
- **Event Callbacks**: Integration hooks for real-time operational telemetry

## Core Components

### EventStore (`src/eventstore/`)
The top-level orchestration layer coordinating storage, indexing, query execution, WAL, and recovery. Provides the primary `EventStore` interface for applications.

**Key responsibilities**:
- Coordinate persistent record storage and multi-index maintenance
- Manage query execution and crash safety
- Provide checkpoint and compaction APIs
- Expose operational metrics and listeners

### Storage Layer (`src/storage/`)
Foundational persistence using append-only file segments, TLV serialization, and position-based addressing.

**Key characteristics**:
- WORM (Write-Once, Read-Many) model
- Page-aligned (4KB/8KB/16KB) data layout

### WAL (`src/wal/`)
Industry-standard write-ahead logging ensuring durability and enabling crash recovery.

**Design**:
- Log-Sequence Numbers (LSN) for monotonic ordering
- Configurable sync modes: always/batch/never
- Segment rotation and cleanup (default 1GB segments)
- CRC64-ECMA integrity validation

### Recovery (`src/recovery/`)
Robust crash recovery replay from WAL with index validation and fallback segment rebuild.

**Capabilities**:
- Dirty-marker based recovery detection
- Checkpoint-optimized replay
- Index compatibility validation
- Segment rebuild for corrupted indexes

### Cache System (`src/cache/`)
Multi-level caching with dynamic allocation for optimal performance across varying workloads.

**Layers**:
- Generic LRU cache (count and memory-based)
- B-tree node caching with multi-writer support
- Dynamic allocator balancing capacity 70% + access patterns 30%
- Partition coordinator: 60% active + 30% recent + 10% historical

### Metrics (`src/metrics/`)
Low-overhead observability with Prometheus integration.

**Exports**:
- Write/query counters and latencies
- Cache/index/shard/storage snapshots
- `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus text format v0.0.4)
- `/health` endpoint for operational status

## Configuration

The store uses YAML-based configuration with sensible defaults:

```yaml
storage:
  segment_size_mb: 256
  page_size_bytes: 4096
  
index:
  page_size_bytes: 8192
  node_cache_count: 10000
  enable_partitioning: true
  partition_interval: "monthly"

cache:
  max_size_mb: 512
  
wal:
  segment_size_mb: 1024
  sync_mode: "batch"
  batch_interval_ms: 100
```

See [docs/](docs/) for detailed configuration options.

### Remote Relay Demo
A two-process example where a Nostr relay calls a remote EventStore server via gRPC. The `store/` process runs the EventStore as a gRPC service, while the `relay/` process runs the Nostr relay and accesses storage through the remote RPC client:
```bash
# Terminal 1: start the EventStore gRPC server
cd demos/remote-relay/store
go run . --config ./config.yaml

# Terminal 2: start the Nostr relay
cd demos/remote-relay/relay
go run . --config ./config.yaml --port 7447
```
Connect any Nostr client to `ws://localhost:7447`. See [demos/remote-relay/README.md](demos/remote-relay/README.md) for full details.

### Remote Deployment
Run the store as a remote gRPC service with multi-client access. See the quick start guide:
[demos/remote-quick-start/README.md](demos/remote-quick-start/README.md)

### Distributed Deployment (In Development)
Run the store with shard coordination across local/remote shards for horizontal scaling. See the demo guide:
[demos/shard-coordinator-demo/README.md](demos/shard-coordinator-demo/README.md)

## Design Philosophy

1. **Coordinator-Centric**: Storage, index, and query are independent; integration happens in EventStore
2. **Crash-Safe Intent Logging**: WAL ensures durability before state mutations
3. **Index Consistency**: Index insert failures are logged (not blocking) to prevent write stalls
4. **Recovery-Oriented**: Always recovers from invalid/dirty index files via WAL/segments
5. **Operational Visibility**: Rich stats, listener hooks, and explicit maintenance APIs

## Key Design Decisions

| Design              | Rationale                          | Tradeoff                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Write-Ahead Logging | Industry-standard durability       | Small performance overhead   |
| B+Tree Indexing     | Efficient range queries            | Complexity in implementation |
| LRU Caching         | Simplicity, strong hit rates       | May not suit all patterns    |
| Append-Only Storage | Concurrency, WAL integration       | Additional compaction needed |
| Multi-Index         | Workload-aware optimization        | Memory overhead for indexes  |
| Logical Deletion    | Fast deletes, deferred reclamation | Space until compaction       |
